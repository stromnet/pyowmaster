"""A version of the stock sched module with support for multiple queues with
different priorities.
The difference compared to the sched priority support is that we submit jobs to
different queues, not the same queue with different per-event priorities.

This solves the problem when multiple events are submitted, having an earlier time
than a prioritized one, but taking so long that the more prioritized event is delayed
long after we want to execute it.

To use, create one scheduler instance, and then create one or more queues.
The queues are prioritzed in the order they are created, first has highest priority.

Lots of code copied from base sched implementation. The main usage differences are:
- time and delay are functions which can be overriden by subclassing
- multiple queues are created manually
- events are submitted to individual queues rather than scheduler
